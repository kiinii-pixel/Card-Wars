# Card-Wars
This project is about turning the Card Wars TCG (from Adventure Time) into a playable **video game**.
Once I implement the core mechanics of the TCG I will likely turn it into its own unique game, or my interpretation of Card Wars.
This will include **New Cards!** BPDrej has been hard at work creating a **new Landscape Type!** More on that below.
For now, the Goal is a PC, or Browser Friendly Game.

## Goals: 
### Done:
  - Dynamic Cards (stats can be updated in real time)
  - Drag and Drop system
  - Hover Animations
  - Automatic Hand spacing
  - Drawing and Playing Cards
  - Decks
  - Fighting
  - Discard Pile

### Next:
  - Card Effects
  - Spell Zone
  - Main Menu

### Nerdy Details:
  - ~~Data can be read from a JSON file containing the stats, description, etc. of every card.~~
  - Cards are now saved as indididual Resources containing all their stats. This might be a good place to implement their effects too.
  - Cards use a template so that only the art's image of the card needs to be saved and everything else is dynamic (no scans and real time stat changes).

### **Dreams**, or: Unrealistic, Delusional Goals
  - Move the game to 3D (Like Hearthstone)
  - 3D Models for Cards that play animations according to their actions
  - Cross Platform (Console, Mobile, PC)
  - VR compatibility (very delusional)

## New Content
We (mostly  BPDrej) have been brainstorming and working on a new Landscape Type, The Blazing Badlands, for years now. (The Artowork is 100% up to official standards aswell!)
I'm excited to have a talented artist, capable of official looking artowrk, working with me on this project.
